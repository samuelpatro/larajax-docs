# ESM Control Registration

For larger applications, it is recommended to define controls in separate files using ES modules and register them from a central location. This approach provides better code organization, tree-shaking support, and easier maintenance.

## Project Structure

Controls are organized in a dedicated directory with each control in its own file:

```
resources/js/
├── controls.js              # Central registration file
└── controls/
    ├── popup-control.js
    ├── phone-input-control.js
    ├── address-input-control.js
    └── ...
```

## Defining a Control Class

Each control is defined in its own file and exported as the default export. The class extends `ControlBase` imported from larajax.

```js
// controls/popup-control.js
import { ControlBase } from "larajax";

export default class PopupControl extends ControlBase
{
    init() {
        this.$content = this.element.querySelector('.popup-content');
    }

    connect() {
        this.listen('click', '.popup-trigger', this.onTriggerClick);
    }

    onTriggerClick() {
        this.$content.classList.toggle('is-visible');
    }
}
```

## Central Registration

Import all controls and register them in a single entry point file. This provides a clear overview of all available controls and their identifiers.

```js
// controls.js
import { registerControl } from "larajax"

import PopupControl from './controls/popup-control';
import PhoneInputControl from './controls/phone-input-control';
import AddressInputControl from './controls/address-input-control';

// General
registerControl('popup', PopupControl);

// Form Components
registerControl('phone-input', PhoneInputControl);
registerControl('address-input', AddressInputControl);
```

::: tip
Group related controls with comments to improve readability and make it easier to find specific registrations.

## Lazy Registration

Controls that are large or appear on few pages can be imported on demand. Pass a function that returns the import instead of the class. The control file, and everything it imports, loads when the first element with that control appears on the page.

```js
// controls.js
registerControl('code-editor', () => import('./controls/code-editor-control'));
```

Elements added while the control loads are connected once it is ready. If the import fails, the error is reported and the elements stay unconnected. When bundling, enable code splitting so the import becomes a separate file (esbuild needs `format: 'esm'` and `splitting: true`).

## Benefits

This approach offers several advantages over inline registration:

- **Separation of concerns** - Each control lives in its own file with focused responsibility
- **Tree-shaking** - Bundlers can eliminate unused controls from production builds
- **Testability** - Controls can be imported and tested in isolation
- **IDE support** - Better autocomplete, navigation, and refactoring support
- **Reusability** - Controls can be shared across projects via npm packages

## Naming Conventions

Follow these conventions for consistency:

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| File name | kebab-case with `-control` suffix | `phone-input-control.js` |
| Class name | PascalCase with `Control` suffix | `PhoneInputControl` |
| Control identifier | kebab-case matching the component | `phone-input` |

## Including in Your Build

Ensure the central registration file is included in your JavaScript bundle entry point:

```js
// app.js
import './controls';
```

This will execute the registration code and make all controls available to the page observer.
